10 useful rules for having a better conversation -

1.  *Don't multitask*
  - Be mentally present in the conversation.
  - This doesn't mean just keeping your cell phones away.
  - If you wanna go out of the conversation *got out*, but don't be half in it and half out.

2.  *Don't Pontificate*
  - Write a blog instead, if you want to state your opinion without seeking a response.
  - Enter conversation assuming you have something to learn.
  - Set aside your personal opinion.

  > Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.

3. *Use open ended questions*
  - Don't ask a complicated question - You are going to get a simple answer.
  - Who, when, where, why, how. Keep it at that.
  - Let them describe it.

4. *Go with the flow*
  - Thoughts will come into your mind, and you need to let them go out of your mind.
  - Don't get stuck to a thought while listening to a conversation (thinking of a really nice question you want to ask)
  - Stories and ideas will come to you, let them come and go.
5. *If you don't know, say that you don't know*
  > Talk should not be cheap
6. *Don't equate your experience with theirs*
  - It is not about you
  - If they talk about having lost a family member don't start talking about the time you lost a family member.
  > Conversations are not a promotional opportunity
7. *Try not to repeat yourself*
  - It's condescending, and boring.
  - Don't keep repeating and rephrasing to make a point.

8. *Stay out of the weeds*
  - People don't care about the details like names,dates.
  - They care about you(what you're like, what you have in common)

9. *Listen*
  > If your mouth is open, you're not learning

10. *Be brief*
  > A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.
